# Cubewars
Cubewars was originally a basic Blender game made to demonstrate the game engine when I (Logan) was bored. It's a platform with 2 cubes that face each other and with holes in it randomly displaced, and you can move forward and back, and turn right or left. My friend Ian decided we should now try to recreate it using purely Javascript and HTML5, and so that's what you see here. It relies on the three.js and Cannon.js for the 3D rendering and physics engine, respectively.
