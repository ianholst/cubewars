# Cubewars
Cubewars was originally a basic Blender game made to demonstrate the game engine. Players control two cubes on a platform that face each other and with holes in it randomly displaced. Here it is recreated using purely web technologies, relying on three.js and Cannon.js for the 3D rendering and physics engine, respectively.

## Controls
Player 1: Arrow keys to move, Shift to jump  
Player 2: WASD to move, Q to jump  
ESC resets the game.

## Todo
 - [ ] Add score tallying
 - [ ] Fix "fall through start" issue
