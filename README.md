# Cubewars
Cubewars was originally a basic Blender game made to demonstrate the game engine. Players control two cubes on a platform that face each other and with holes in it randomly displaced, and you can move forward and back, and turn right or left. We decided to recreate it using purely web technologies, relying on three.js and Cannon.js for the 3D rendering and physics engine, respectively.
